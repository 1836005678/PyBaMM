# An asymptotic derivation of a single particle model with electrolyte

This folder contains scripts to generate results in:

_Marquis, S, Sulzer, V, Timms, R, Please, CP, Chapman, SJ "An asymptotic derivation of a single particle model with electrolyte", (2019)_

For quick viewing purposes, the plots are generated using `matplotlib`. However, the actual paper employs `pgfplots` (within `LaTex`) so there is an additional option to output the results as a csv file (off by default).
