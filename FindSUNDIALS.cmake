# Find SUNDIALS, the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.
#
# The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument. If no COMPONENTS
# are specified, then the find module will default to find all the SUNDIALS
# libraries. If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt to
# find the specified components.
#
# Valid components are
#   * sundials_cvode
#   * sundials_cvodes
#   * sundials_ida
#   * sundials_idas
#   * sundials_kinsol
#   * sundials_nvecserial
#   * sundials_nvecopenmp
#   * sundials_nvecpthreads
#
#
# On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable SUNDIALS_PREFER_STATIC_LIBRARIES
# to determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for SUNDIALS
# and all of it's dependencies.  To use this feature, make sure that the
# SUNDIALS_PREFER_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.
#
# To provide the module with a hint about where to find your SUNDIALS installation,
# you can set the environment variable SUNDIALS_ROOT. The FindSUNDIALS module will
# then look in this path when searching for SUNDIALS paths and libraries.
#
# This module will define the following variables:
#  SUNDIALS_FOUND - true if SUNDIALS was found on the system
#  SUNDIALS_INCLUDE_DIRS - Location of the SUNDIALS includes
#  SUNDIALS_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for all requested components
#  SUNDIALS_VERSION_MAJOR - Major version
#  SUNDIALS_VERSION_MINOR - Minro version
#  SUNDIALS_VERSION_PATCH - Patch level
#  SUNDIALS_VERSION - Full version string
#
# This module exports the target SUNDIALS::<component> if it was found.
