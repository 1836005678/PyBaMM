    "## Changing a submodel in an exisiting battery model\n",
    "PyBaMM is designed to be a flexible modelling package that allows users to easily compare different models and numerical techniques within a common framework. Battery models within PyBaMM are built up using a number of submodels that describe different physics included within the model, such as mass conservation in the electrolyte or charge conservation in the solid. For ease of use, a number of popular battery models are pre-configured in PyBaMM. As an example, we look at the Single Particle Model (for more information see [here](./models/SPM.ipynb)). First we import PyBaMM and any other packages we need"
